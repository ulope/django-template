What is this?
=============

A simple django project template with a few sane (for me) defaults.

I don't expect this to be useful to anybody else.

Usage
=====

`curl -L bit.ly/mkdjango | bash`

In this simple case the name of the activated virtualenv is used as project name
and target directory.

You may also specify a different project name:

`curl -L bit.ly/mkdjango | bash -s - <project-name>`
